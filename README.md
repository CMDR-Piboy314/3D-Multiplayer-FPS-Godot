# 3D-Multiplayer-FPS-Godot
A 3D Multiplayer FPS game made with the Godot Game Engine

In the lobby.gd script replace 127.0.0.1 with your ip address and set up port forwarding on your router for port 7070 to play with people outside your network. In the builds there are 2 builds one with my servers and one with localhost. Do not hesitate to report issues and add pull requests! Help would be greatly appreciated!
